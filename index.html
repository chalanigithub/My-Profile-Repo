        <!--INTEREST IN IT-->

        <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>In today’s world everything depends on Information Technology from food processing, medical systems, manufacturing, defence systems, automobile to space centres. Therefore, Information technology is a field with lots of curiosity and potential. Due to its high demand, I became interested in finding my ways through the river of Information Technology industry. As a matter of fact, I started to interest and learn more about Information Technology since I started to study it as a school subject at the secondary school. Furthermore, my uncle who is an IT Engineer has always sparked my interest in Information Technology since my childhood. My experience in IT is limited with basic and intermediate computer skills which I obtained through following Association for Computer Science and Automatic Calculation (AICA Italy).</li>

          <p><li>Since I was interested in IT, I wanted to take my higher education in Information Technology. I did a little bit of research to find a suitable University for me. Then, I found RMIT University as a reputed and modern Australian University which has lot of opportunities for students to grow and improve their hard skills and soft skills with hands on experience. As a consequence, I chose RMIT University to further enrich my knowledge in Information Technology and computing to obtain better job opportunities in the future.</li></p>


          <p><li>With my higher studies at RMIT University, I am looking forward to gaining more knowledge and experience in IT Industry. Most importantly to grasp new technological ideas and skills required in Network and Systems Engineering to help the society to enrich the mankind. Also, I expect to collaborate and actively participate in group projects with other students to acquire more exposure to industry based projects.</li></p>

        </ul>
